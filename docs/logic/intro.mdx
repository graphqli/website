So far Apito Generates all the CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) API instantly based on your model but what happens when you need to make a custom request or need to
**execute a business logic** or need to **connect to any third-party api?**

Apito is very extensible. You can extend your api or write your own endpoint on apito using custom function that can hold your custom logic & integration.

## Supported Cloud Provider

* AWS Lambda

:::note
Apito doesn't host any functions on our server. It depends on third party function host provider (AWS, Google etc..)
:::

Apito will Connect your `Apito Function` to your `AWS Lambda functions`. Each function you create here should be connected to a separate AWS Lambda function in-order to
operate.
